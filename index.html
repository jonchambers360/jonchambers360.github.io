    <p>Illuminated Targets is an agile and responsive consultancy firm, with deep expertise in pharmaceutical target biology.</p>

    <p>We provide bespoke, cost effective solutions to a wide variety 
            of the target-related issues around the process of progressing towards and beyond a New Drug Application.</p>
    
    <p>Typically, for a target, or lists of targets, we build datasets and reports to inform and support target investment decisions: 
            from target prioritization and risk mitigation, 
    to the identification of novel therapeutic opportunities.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Also, in addition to providing data and expertise for the formal submission of documents to regulatory bodies, 
    we can also mine for datasets to address very specific research questions for which a client may not be equipped to mine for themselves.</p>
    
    <p>
    To deliver these services we rely upon both our deep domain knowledge of target biology,
     and our internally developed modern AI-enabled pipelines to mine the public biomedical literature and databases.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    And for projects which extend beyond the target-centric expertise within Illuminated Targets, we are able to call upon a network of consultants: 
    from toxicologists and chemists through to bioinformaticians and statisticians.
